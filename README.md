# MolSysSuite Tutorials

This repository contains tutorials, workshops, and learning material for the **MolSysSuite** ecosystem.

Tutorials are organized by tool and are intended to be:
- self-contained,
- reproducible,
- independent of the main code repositories.

Individual tool repositories link here via `resources/tutorials.yml`.

## Structure

- `tutorials/<tool>/<slug>/`
  - `README.md`
  - `tutorial.ipynb` (or `tutorial.md`)
  - `environment.yml` (recommended)
